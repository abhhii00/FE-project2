This time i understood better, that how to make the website resposive for mobile screens, and hence applied whatever i learnt.
There were few problems i faced but somehow managed and hence it was easy peasy after that.
There is a slight difference in the width in mobile screen like i have to zoom out a lil bit, and i think that is probably because of the add to bag button kinda floating top right of the image and thats what i think should make it a little less to the outside and see what happens.

this is where my log ends and i will try building and deploying another website/design.
